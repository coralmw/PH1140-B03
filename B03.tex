\title[PH1140 Report - T GM Parks]{PH1140 Scientific Skills: Report Poisson statistics using $\gamma$ radiation}

\author{T GM Parks\\28th December 2014}

\begin{abstract}
The distribution of the number of $\gamma$ emissions observed from a radioactive source in a constant time was shown to be modelled by a Poisson distribution. We used a GM tube to count $\gamma$ emissions from a Caesium-137 source for 10 seconds 100 times, and found that the mean, standard deviation and the 'shape' of the distribution of counts was modelled well by a Poisson distribution.
